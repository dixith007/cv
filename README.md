Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well!

I wanted to share that I'm currently exploring new opportunities and would be excited to contribute to a dynamic team like yours. I’ve been working at EXL for the past 1.8 years as a Manual and Automation Tester, gaining hands-on experience in Selenium with Java, test case design, defect tracking, and more.

Alongside my QA experience, I’ve also developed strong skills in SQL, Power BI, and basic Python—allowing me to support data analysis and visualization tasks effectively.

I’m enthusiastic about bringing a blend of QA expertise and data knowledge to support the team’s goals and deliver high-quality outcomes. I’ve attached my resume for your reference, and I’d love to connect if there’s a potential fit or if you know of any opportunities I should explore.

Thanks for your time and consideration!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
