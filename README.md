Hope you're doing well! I'm currently on the bench and exploring new opportunities within EXL. I have 1.8 years of experience in Manual and Automation Testing (Selenium with Java), along with working knowledge of SQL, Power BI, and basic Python for data validation.

I’d love to contribute to your team if there’s a relevant opportunity. Attaching my resume—would appreciate it if you could keep me in mind.

Thanks so much!
