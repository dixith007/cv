 
Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm based in Bangalore. I have around 1.5 years of experience in data analytics, currently working as a BI Developer at EXL Services., with a  focus on SQL development and data validation.
In my current role at EXL Services, I primarily work on writing and optimizing SQL queries to support backend data validation,

I'm also comfortable using functions, subqueries, joins, and date transformations in SQL for both analysis and testing purposes.
During my internship, I was involved in data visualization and testing, but my core strength lies in database querying and ensuring data correctness — which I believe is critical for any data-driven system."

Alongside SQL, I’ve also worked with Power BI to help visualize and test data logic on dashboards, writing DAX for custom KPIs. 

Outside of work, I have a creative side—I enjoy video editing and photo editing, which helps me stay detail-oriented and visually focused even in dashboard design
and I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills to your team."
