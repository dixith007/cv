Hi [Recipient's Name],

Hope you're doing well!

I’ve been on the bench for a while now and wanted to reach out to explore any available opportunities within EXL. During this time, I’ve taken the initiative to upskill myself—I've improved my SQL skills, learned Power BI, covered Python basics, and I'm currently pursuing a course on GCP to strengthen my cloud knowledge.

Recently in February, I had the chance to work on a Gen AI project involving manual testing. Prior to that, I was part of the CVS Healthcare project, where I worked on both manual and automation testing using Selenium WebDriver with Java.

I’m really eager to contribute and would love to be considered for any openings where I can be of value to the team. Please let me know if there’s anything suitable Project for me. I’ve also attached my resume for your reference.

Thanks in advance for your time and support!

Best regards,
Deekshith KP
