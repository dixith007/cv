Hope you're doing well!
 
I’m currently on the bench and actively looking for new opportunities within EXL. I’ve been working here for the past 1.8 years as a Manual and Automation Tester, with hands-on experience in Selenium WebDriver with Java, test case creation, and defect tracking using Jira.
 
In addition to my QA background, I also have good knowledge of SQL, Power BI, and basic Python, which helps me support data analysis and validation tasks effectively.
 
I’m really eager to join a team where I can contribute meaningfully and be resourceful. Please find my resume attached—I'd be grateful if you could let me know of any openings or keep me in mind for any relevant opportunities.
 
Thanks so much!
