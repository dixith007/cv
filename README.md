Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm based in Bangalore. I have around 1.5 years of experience in data analytics, currently working as a BI Developer at EXL Services. My role involves validating Power BI dashboards, writing and optimizing SQL queries, and creating DAX measures for custom KPIs.
Earlier, during my internship, I built a Menu Analytics dashboard using Tableau and worked on report testing and automation. Outside of work, I have a creative side—I enjoy video editing and photo editing, which helps me stay detail-oriented and visually focused even in dashboard design
and I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills to your team."
