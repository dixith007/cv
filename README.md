 
Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm based in Bangalore. I have around 1.5 years of experience in sql dev, with a  focus on SQL development and data validation.
In my current role at EXL Services, I primarily work on writing and optimizing SQL queries to support backend data validation,

I'm also comfortable using functions, subqueries, joins, and date transformations in SQL for both analysis and testing purposes.

Alongside SQL,During my internship, I’ve also worked with Power BI to help visualize and test data logic on dashboards, writing DAX for custom KPIs. 

Outside of work, I have a creative side—I enjoy video editing and photo editing, which helps me stay detail-oriented and visually focused even in dashboard design
and I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills to your team."

In this project, my main responsibility was to validate and ensure data accuracy in the backend by writing complex SQL queries to test payroll data, KPIs, and trend metrics.
I usedd worked closely with the data team to extract relevant fields, apply business rules using SQL, and verify the outputs across large datasets.

my focus was on backend validation using SQL Server — including joins, aggregations, date transformations, and CASE logic."

As part of my internship, I worked on a Menu Analytics module where I extracted restaurant order data using MySQL, applied logic to calculate key metrics like total orders, revenue, and average ratings.

I wrote SQL queries to prepare the data and later helped the team build visualizations in powerbi. My focus was more on the backend logic — writing test cases, validating stored procedures, and supporting report testing."
