In the CVS (Retail) project, I worked more like a Business Analyst. I was responsible for validating the data shown in Power BI dashboards, checking the logic behind KPIs and visual filters.
I wrote SQL queries to validate data at the source and ensure it matched the visuals and metrics on the dashboards.
To reduce repetitive testing, I also updated and ran Selenium automation scripts and integrated Excel-based data for automated validation.
This project strengthened my skills in BI validation, dashboard testing, and data accuracy.


In the CVS project, apart from validating existing dashboards, I also contributed to creating a simple Power BI dashboard. 
It included key indicators such as Total Sales, Number of Orders, and Average Rating. I used card visuals for KPIs, bar charts to show category-wise performance, and slicers to filter by region and time period.
This helped stakeholders quickly track overall performance and drill down into specific metrics.
I handled data connection, DAX measures, and ensured that visuals accurately reflected backend SQL data
