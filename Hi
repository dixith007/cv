1. What level of comfortability with SQL Server and Oracle SQL?
"I'm very comfortable with SQL Server — I've written and optimized many queries as part of BI validation, including complex joins, subqueries, CTEs, 
and window functions. While my hands-on experience with Oracle is limited, I’ve been exploring its key differences like SYSDATE, TRUNC(), NVL(), 
and string functions. I'm a fast learner and confident in picking up any SQL flavor quickly."

“I’ve mainly worked with MySQL and MS SQL, but I’ve also explored Oracle SQL. One key difference I’ve noticed is in the syntax and functions.
For example, Oracle uses SYSDATE to get the current date, while SQL Server uses GETDATE(). Also, Oracle joins strings using ||, whereas SQL Server uses +.
Another example — in Oracle we use NVL() to handle null values, while in SQL Server it’s ISNULL().
Even the way we limit rows is different: Oracle uses ROWNUM or FETCH FIRST, while SQL Server uses TOP or OFFSET-FETCH.
These are small differences, but the underlying SQL logic is the same, so it’s easy for me to switch and adapt.”

What is || in SQL?
It’s used to join two or more strings together.
Common in Oracle SQL and PostgreSQL.  Example:SELECT 'Hello' || ' ' || 'World' AS greeting  FROM dual;

In MS SQL Server and MySQL, we use + or CONCAT() instead.   SELECT 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World' AS greeting;
                                                            SELECT CONCAT('Hello', ' ', 'World') AS greeting;

2. What do you do to modify the date fields?
"To modify or manipulate date fields, I typically use functions like:
DATEADD() or DATEDIFF() in SQL Server
TRUNC(), ADD_MONTHS(), or EXTRACT() in Oracle

In SQL Server: I use CONVERT(), CAST(), DATEADD(), DATEDIFF(), or FORMAT() depending on the requirement.

In Oracle SQL: I use TO_DATE, TO_CHAR, TRUNC, and arithmetic operations on dates.

For example, to get just the month and year, I might use FORMAT(date_column, 'yyyy-MM') in SQL Server or TO_CHAR(date_column, 'YYYY-MM') in Oracle.
For formatting, I use CONVERT() in SQL Server and TO_CHAR() in Oracle. These help in removing time, calculating date ranges, or formatting for reports."

3. REGEXP_REPLACE(patient_name, '>|<','') — What is the equivalent in MS SQL Server?
"Since SQL Server doesn't support REGEXP_REPLACE() natively, we can achieve this using nested REPLACE() functions for simple cases:
SELECT REPLACE(REPLACE(patient_name, '<', ''), '>', '') AS cleaned_name
FROM patients;
For more advanced patterns, we’d consider using CLR integration or writing a custom function."

4. TRUNC(service_date) — Equivalent in SQL Server? Can it be done without CONVERT()?
“In Oracle SQL, the TRUNC() function is commonly used to remove the time part from a date, keeping only the date portion.
It can also be used to truncate numbers to a specific decimal place.

TRUNC(service_date) in Oracle removes the time portion and returns only the date.

In SQL Server, the closest equivalent is: We use CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE) or CONVERT(DATE, GETDATE()) to achieve the same effect.
SELECT CAST(service_date AS DATE )     or
SELECT CONVERT(DATE, service_date)

5. Do you know functions in Oracle SQL that are not in SQL Server?

NVL() in Oracle vs ISNULL() in SQL Server
DECODE() in Oracle — SQL Server uses CASE instead
DUAL table in Oracle for dummy SELECTs
TRUNC() for dates/numbers in Oracle
SYSDATE in Oracle vs GETDATE() in SQL Server
