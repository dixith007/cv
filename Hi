Hi Rahul,
I received an email stating that I have been placed in the redeployment pool. I wanted to check if there are any available projects that match my experience. I have been working as a Manual Tester at EXL for the past 1.5 years, with experience in manual testing, automation (Selenium with Java), and dashboard validations. Please let me know if any suitable opportunities are available.

Thanks,
Deekshith KP
