Subject: Request to Initiate Supervisor Transfer

Dear [Current Supervisor's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to kindly request that you raise a request to transfer my supervision to [New Supervisor's Name] as soon as possible. The performance appraisal rating is due on 30th May, and it needs to be completed by my new supervisor.

Would appreciate it if this could be done at the earliest to avoid any delays.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Employee ID, if applicable]
