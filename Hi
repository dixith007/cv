Test Case: Verify Rename File Functionality
Test Steps:

Navigate to the left panel and click on the Files icon.

Identify an existing file in the list.

Click the Rename button next to the file name.

Enter a new name in the input field.

Press Enter or click Save to confirm.

Expected Results:

The Rename button should be clearly visible below the + New File button and next to each file.

Clicking Rename should display an editable input field with the existing file name.

The new name should be saved instantly and updated in the file list.

If the name field is empty, an error message should appear:

"File name cannot be empty."

If the new name exceeds the character limit, a validation message should be displayed.

Pressing Esc or refreshing the page should keep the original name unchanged.

Test Case: Verify Delete File Functionality
Test Steps:

Navigate to the left panel and click on the Files icon.

Identify an existing file in the list.

Click the Delete button next to the file name.

Confirm the deletion when prompted.

Expected Results:

The Delete button should be clearly visible next to each file.

Clicking Delete should trigger a confirmation message (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete this file?").

If the user confirms, the file should be removed from the list immediately.

If the user cancels, the file should remain unchanged.

If an error occurs (e.g., network failure), a message should appear (e.g., "Unable to delete file. Please try again.").
