1. What level of comfortability with SQL Server and Oracle SQL?
"I'm very comfortable with SQL Server — I've written and optimized many queries as part of BI validation, including complex joins, subqueries, CTEs, 
and window functions. While my hands-on experience with Oracle is limited, I’ve been exploring its key differences like SYSDATE, TRUNC(), NVL(), 
and string functions. I'm a fast learner and confident in picking up any SQL flavor quickly."

2. What do you do to modify the date fields?
"To modify or manipulate date fields, I typically use functions like:
DATEADD() or DATEDIFF() in SQL Server
TRUNC(), ADD_MONTHS(), or EXTRACT() in Oracle

In SQL Server: I use CONVERT(), CAST(), DATEADD(), DATEDIFF(), or FORMAT() depending on the requirement.

In Oracle SQL: I use TO_DATE, TO_CHAR, TRUNC, and arithmetic operations on dates.

For example, to get just the month and year, I might use FORMAT(date_column, 'yyyy-MM') in SQL Server or TO_CHAR(date_column, 'YYYY-MM') in Oracle.
For formatting, I use CONVERT() in SQL Server and TO_CHAR() in Oracle. These help in removing time, calculating date ranges, or formatting for reports."

3. REGEXP_REPLACE(patient_name, '>|<','') — What is the equivalent in MS SQL Server?
"Since SQL Server doesn't support REGEXP_REPLACE() natively, we can achieve this using nested REPLACE() functions for simple cases:
SELECT REPLACE(REPLACE(patient_name, '<', ''), '>', '') AS cleaned_name
FROM patients;
For more advanced patterns, we’d consider using CLR integration or writing a custom function."

4. TRUNC(service_date) — Equivalent in SQL Server? Can it be done without CONVERT()?
TRUNC(service_date) in Oracle removes the time portion and returns only the date.
In SQL Server, the most direct way is:
In SQL Server, the closest equivalent is:
SELECT CAST(service_date AS DATE )     or
SELECT CONVERT(DATE, service_date)

5. Do you know functions in Oracle SQL that are not in SQL Server?

NVL() in Oracle vs ISNULL() in SQL Server
DECODE() in Oracle — SQL Server uses CASE instead
DUAL table in Oracle for dummy SELECTs
TRUNC() for dates/numbers in Oracle
SYSDATE in Oracle vs GETDATE() in SQL Server
