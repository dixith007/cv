Subject: Acknowledgment of Redeployment Pool Notification

Hi Ravindra,

I acknowledge the update regarding my project release and placement in the redeployment pool. I will monitor my mailbox for suitable IJP opportunities and remain available as required.

Please let me know if there are any specific steps I need to take during this transition.

Best regards,
Deekshith KP
