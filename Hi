Test Case: Verify File Search Functionality
Test Case ID	FILE-03
Test Scenario	Verify that users can search for files using the search bar.
Test Steps	1. Navigate to the left panel and click on the Files icon.
2. Locate the Search bar at the top of the file list.
3. Enter a valid file name or part of the name.
4. Observe the search results.
Expected Results	1. The Search bar should be clearly visible and functional.
2. Typing a valid file name should dynamically filter the file list, showing only matching results.
3. If no matching file is found, a message should appear (e.g., "No files found.").
4. Search should be case-insensitive (e.g., searching "report" should match "Report.pdf").
5. Clearing the search field should restore the full file list.
