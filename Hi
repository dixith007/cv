In the CVS (Retail) project, I worked more like a Business Analyst. I was responsible for validating the data shown in Power BI dashboards, checking the logic behind KPIs and visual filters.
I wrote SQL queries to validate data at the source and ensure it matched the visuals and metrics on the dashboards.
To reduce repetitive testing, I also updated and ran Selenium automation scripts and integrated Excel-based data for automated validation.
This project strengthened my skills in BI validation, dashboard testing, and data accuracy.
