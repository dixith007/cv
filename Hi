I will support business development efforts by preparing data-driven summaries and reusable SQL logic that can be used for future client requests or dashboards. I will contribute to documentation, query libraries, and internal knowledge sharing that improves the team's ability to respond faster to similar business queries in other projects. If required, I will assist in preparing inputs or insights for decks used in showcasing our capabilities to clients.
