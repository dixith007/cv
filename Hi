Subject: Clarification on Redeployment Pool Notification

Hi Ravindra,

Thank you for the update. However, I would like to clarify that I am currently working on the GenService AI project from FRB and actively contributing.

Could you please confirm if this notification was sent in error, or if there is any action required from my side?

Looking forward to your guidance.

Best regards,
Deekshith KP
