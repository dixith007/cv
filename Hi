Hi, I’m Deekshith KP. I have 1.8 years of experience as a Quality Analyst with a strong focus on data validation, dashboard testing, and functional analysis. 
Over the past few months, I’ve been transitioning into a Business Analyst and Data role, actively working with tools like SQL, Power BI, and Excel to support data-driven decision-making.

Recently, I worked on a Generative AI project where I was involved in chatbot flow testing, data verification, and feedback tagging. 
Prior to that, I contributed to CVS Healthcare’s reporting transformation by validating dashboards, automating backend tests using Selenium with Java, and ensuring data accuracy with SQL.

I also worked on a healthcare migration project where I validated complex business rules and collaborated closely with cross-functional teams.
Alongside my professional experience, I’m currently upskilling in Python and Google Cloud Platform to deepen my analytics and cloud capabilities.

I’m passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights, 
and I’m excited about roles that combine data analysis, business understanding, and technology to solve real-world problems.”
