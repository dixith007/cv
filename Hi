Test Case: Verify File Upload Functionality
Test Steps:

Navigate to the left panel and click on the Files icon.

Click on Create File, then:

Click Choose File and select a file.

Enter a File Name (optional: enter a description).

Click Create to upload the file.

Expected Results:

The Files icon should be clearly visible and clickable in the left panel.

Clicking Create File should display a form with File Upload, Name, and Description fields.

Users should be able to select files in supported formats (e.g., PDFs).

If the file or name field is empty, a validation message should appear:

"Please select a file" (if no file is chosen).

"File name is required" (if the name is empty).

The file should upload successfully even without a description.

The selected file should be visible in the file list, showing name and size.

Users should be able to view the uploaded file after successful upload.

If an unsupported file type is uploaded, a clear error message should be displayed.
